\subsection{General scheme}
\begin{frame}
  Due to the cost of assessing each of the different solutions, it was decided
  to design a local search to only evaluate a small neighborhood.
  The movement is, remove the server with less workload,
  and place it near the server with the increased workload.
  Looking for a better balance workloads.

\subsection{Test}
\begin{frame}
  The test are pending due to a detected error in the Mean Service Time 
  Calibration process.

  Although some results showed an improvement in average solutions generated by
  Berman Heuristic.

  In 500 random solutions, the average improvement gained by usign Berman
  Heuristic was 27.21\% , after that, an average improvement of 4.52\% 
  is gained using Local Search.

  Using only Local Search, the average improvement gained is 16.52\%
