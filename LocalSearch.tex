\section{Local Search}
\subsection{General scheme}
\begin{frame}
  Due to the cost of assessing each of the different solutions, it was decided
  to design a local search to only evaluate a small neighborhood.
  The movement is, remove the server with less workload,
  and place it near the server with the increased workload.
  Looking for a better balance workloads.
\end{frame}
% Remove
% Moves

\subsection{Test}
\begin{frame}
  The test consist in 
  generate a solution by the multistart,
  then apply one heuristic (Berman or Local Search),
  then apply the other.
  To determine the best order to use.

  The tables show the improvement over the multistart solution
